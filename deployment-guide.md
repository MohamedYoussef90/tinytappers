### Step-by-Step Deployment to GitHub Pages

   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up

2. **Create a new repository**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name it `tinytappers` or any name you prefer
   - Make it public
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload your files**
   - Click "uploading an existing file" link on the repository page
   - Drag and drop or select all your website files:
     - index.html (renamed from improved-index.html)
     - styles.css (renamed from improved-styles.css)
     - script.js (renamed from improved-script.js)
     - Any sound files in their respective folders
   - Add a commit message like "Initial upload of TinyTappers website"
   - Click "Commit changes"

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository "Settings"
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait a few minutes for deployment

5. **Access your website**
   - GitHub will provide a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/tinytappers`
   - This is your live website!

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain like `tinytappers.com`:

1. **Purchase a domain**
   - Use a domain registrar like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains
   - Cost: ~$10-15 per year for a .com domain

2. **Configure DNS**
   - In your domain registrar's dashboard, add these records:
     - A record: `@` pointing to `185.199.108.153`
     - A record: `@` pointing to `185.199.109.153`
     - A record: `@` pointing to `185.199.110.153`
     - A record: `@` pointing to `185.199.111.153`
     - CNAME record: `www` pointing to `yourusername.github.io`

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - In repository Settings > GitHub Pages
   - Enter your custom domain
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS"

## Maintaining Your Website

1. **Making updates**
   - Edit files directly on GitHub or upload new versions
   - Changes will automatically deploy

2. **Monitoring**
   - Check GitHub Pages settings for any deployment issues
   - Test your website regularly on different devices

## Alternative Deployment: Netlify Drag-and-Drop

For the simplest possible deployment without GitHub:

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
2. Click "Sites" then "Drag and drop your site folder here"
3. Drag your entire website folder
4. Netlify will deploy your site and give you a URL like `random-name.netlify.app`
5. You can change this to a custom subdomain or connect your own domain

## Costs Summary

- **Basic Hosting**: $0 (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages)
- **Custom Domain**: ~$10-15/year
- **SSL Certificate**: $0 (provided free by all recommended hosting options)

Total annual cost: $0-15 depending on domain needs
